PLG_SYSTEM_SITEMAPCACHE="Sitemap cache"
PLG_SITEMAPCACHE_DESCRIPTION="<p>You might not know that using such popular extensions, as OSMap, XMap, MapX without caching can down your server completely. It is easy to make your site unresponsible by doing a school DDOS (HTTP flood) attack from a mobile phone, sitting in front of TV. This is because sitemap generators require a lot of server resources to run heavy SQL queries for building the sitemap.</p><p>I wrote this lightweight plugin to make the sitemap generators fast and secure, because there were not clean solutions for XMap based generators that would work without errors. This plugin is like the standart Joomla! Page Cache plugin, but only for sitemap generators. It does not run SQL queries to get the cache, it does not run SQL queries to store the cache â€“ it uses your system configuration.
